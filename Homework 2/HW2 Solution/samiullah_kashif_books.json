The top most node of XML document is converted to an object in JSON represented by {}

Inside the object, it has key value pair.

Key is "items" and value contains 2 more objects i.e. book and cd

The book tag becomes the key for the first object. The value is another object which has many key value pairs separated by commas

The key for first pair is "publisher" and its value is "Addison-Wesley"

The key for second pair is "author" and value is an array containing details of 3 authors

The first element of the array is a string which is the name of the author

The second element is an object because it has 2 elements inside it
The key for the first element is "first-name" and its value is "Rick"
The key for the second element is "last-name" and its value is "Hull"

The third element of the array is again an object and has 2 key value pairs.
In the first pair, key is "-age" and it's value is "20". We use "-age" because it denotes that it is an attribute and not a child element
In the second pair, key is "#text" and value is "Victor Vianu". This tells us  that Victor Vianus is the text of the element

Then we have some more key value pairs for title, year and price

This is the end of the 1st object

For the second object, key is "cd" and value is an object. Inside the object we have key value pairs separated by commas.

In the first pair, "-price" is the key and it's value is "55". Since we have used "-price", it denotes that it is an attribute for the element CD

The second pair contains "publisher" as key and "Freeman" as value. They have simply been derived from the element <publisher>

The third pair has "author" as key and an object as value.
The object contains 2 key value pairs:
"-age": "30" denotes that it is an attribute of the element author
"#text": "Mary Lee" denotes that it is the text for the the element author

Then we have 2 more key value pairs:
"title": "A wonderful world! "
"year": " 1998 "

Both of them have been derived from the text and value of the element
